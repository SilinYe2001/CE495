@W: MT531 :"/home/sfs6562/CE495-Digital-design-and-Verification/HW2/src/matmul.sv":56:4:56:7|Found signal identified as System clock which controls 32 sequential elements including matmul_instance.z_din[31:0].  Using this clock, which has no specified timing constraint, can prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and can adversely impact design performance.
